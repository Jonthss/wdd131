                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Jonathas Barbosa de Oliveira and I was born in the beautiful city of João Pessoa, located in the state of Paraíba, in the wonderful country of Brazil! For as long as I can remember, the vibrant colors and lively sounds of this region have been part of my life. João Pessoa, the third oldest city in Brazil, with its stunning beaches and welcoming people, has always had a special place in my heart. Born under the warmth of the northeastern sun and lulled by the sea breeze, I carry with me the roots and culture of this rich and diverse land.</p>
